# parkinsense_app
Parkinsense app created with react native and expo

App was created with help from the following link: https://www.cjoshmartin.com/blog/bluetooth-low-energy-ble-with-react-native-and-arduino
react native version: 0.74.5
Gradle version: 8.8

Current version is likely not scalable, has no backend support, and may have security flaws. Advise caution when testing
